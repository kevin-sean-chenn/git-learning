# git-learning
First Repository, learning how git works and how it functions with github.

Hello Fellow Readers (Pehaps future employers, btw please hire me)

I'm Kevin Chen and am currently a Boston University Science pursuing a BSBA in Business Administration with Concentration in Finance

This respository is a trail respository for me to mingle with and learn how git works. I think transparency is the best when looking for a job so my entire journey/process of learning Algo Trading and Quant will be published on my GitHub

:)
